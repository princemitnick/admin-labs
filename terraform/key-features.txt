Infrastructure as Code : 
Your Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax.
This allows your infrastructure to be versioned and treated asyou would any other code. 
It can also be shared and re-used.

Execution Plans : 
Terraform generates an execution plan with its "planning" step.
This show what Terraform will do when you 
apply the configuration. THis allows you to avoid any 
surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.

Resource Graph : 
Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible,
and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
It accomplishes this by building a graph of all your resources,
and it gives you greater insight into the creation and modification
of any non-dependent resources.
